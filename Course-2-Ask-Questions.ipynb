    "\n",
    "### Six Data Analysis Phases\n",
    "1. __Ask__: Things to ask when attempting to solve a problem\n",
    "   - Define the problem you're trying to solve\n",
    "   - Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder's expectations\n",
    "   - Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions\n",
    "   - Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication\n",
    "   - Take a step back and see the whole situation in context\n",
    "        __Questions to ask yourself!__\n",
    "            - Whare my stakeholders saying their problems are?\n",
    "            - Now that I've identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. __Prepare__: Decide what type of data you need to collect to answer your questions and organize it\n",
    "   - What metrics to use\n",
    "   - Locate data in your database\n",
    "   - Create security measures to protect the data\n",
    "     __Questions to ask yourself!__\n",
    "         - What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?\n",
    "         - What research do I need to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "3. __Process__: Clean your data to eliminate any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies\n",
    "   - Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data\n",
    "   - Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces\n",
    "   - Removing repeated entries\n",
    "   - Checking as much as possible for bias in the data\n",
    "     __Questions to ask yourself!__\n",
    "        - What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?\n",
    "        - How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "4. __Analyze__: Sort and format your data to make it easier to read\n",
    "   - Perform calculations\n",
    "   - Combine data from multiple sources\n",
    "   - Create tables with your results\n",
    "    __Questions to ask yourself!__\n",
    "        - What story is my data telling me?\n",
    "        - How will my data help me solve this problem?\n",
    "        - Who needs my company's product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "5. __Share__: Summarize results with clear and enticing visuals of analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards.\n",
    "   - You team will make better decisions\n",
    "   - Team will make more informed decisions\n",
    "   - Team will lead to stronger outcomes\n",
    "   - Team will successfully communicate your findings\n",
    "     __Questions to ask yourself!__\n",
    "        - How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?\n",
    "        - What would help me understand this if I were the listener?\n",
    "\n",
    "          \n",
    "6. __Act__: Provide recommendations to stakeholders based on your findings to allow the, to make data-driven decisions\n",
    "   __Questions to ask yourself!__\n",
    "       - How can I use the feedback I received durung the share phase to actually meet the stakeholders needs and expectations?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Structured Thinking__\n",
    "1. Recognizing the current problem or situation\n",
    "2. Organizing avaiable information\n",
    "3. Revealing gaps and opportunities\n",
    "4. Identifying your options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Problem Types\n",
    "1. __Making Predictions__: using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future.\n",
    "2. __Categorizing Things__: assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features\n",
    "3. __Spotting something unusual__: identifying data that is different from the norm\n",
    "4. __Identifying Themes__: takes catergorizing a step further by grouping categorized information into broader concepts\n",
    "5. __Discovering Connections__: finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them\n",
    "6. __Finding Patterns__: using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMART questions!\n",
    "- Question should be open-ended! This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutioins to specific problem.\n",
    "- Is the data showing me something superficially? Is there a conflict somewhere that needs to be resolved?\n",
    "- Leading Question\n",
    "- Closed-Ended Question\n",
    "- Vague and lacks context\n",
    "- __S__ pecfic: questions that are simple, significant, and focused on a signle topic or a few closely related ideas.\n",
    "    - if ideas are too general, try to narrow it down by fousing on just one element.\n",
    "    - Is the question specific? Does it address the probrlem? Does it have context? Will it uncover a lot of the information you need?\n",
    "        - ie.\n",
    "          - Instead of asking closed ended questions (Are kids getting enough exercise these days?\", you can ask \"What percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week?\"\n",
    "- __M__ easurable: questions that can be quantified and assessed.\n",
    "    - Will the question give you answer that you can measure?\n",
    "    - ie. Instead of asking, \"Why did our recent video go viral?\" you can ask, \"How many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted?\"\n",
    "- __A__ ction-oriented: questions that encourage change\n",
    "    - Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan?\n",
    "    - ie. Instead of asking \"How can we get customers to recycle our product packaging?\" you should ask, \"What design features will make our packaging easier to recycle?\"\n",
    "- __R__ elevant: questions that are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
    "    - is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?\n",
    "    - ie. Instead of asking, \"Why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing?\", you can ask, \"What environmental factors changed in Durham, North Carolina, between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from Sandhills region?\"\n",
    "- __T__ ime-bound: questions that specify the time to be studied.\n",
    "    - Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Fairness__: ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias\n",
    "\n",
    "__TYPE OF QUESTIONS TO AVOID__:\n",
    "- Leading questions! It leads to only have a particular response.\n",
    "- Closed-ended questions! Questions that ask for one-word or brief response only.\n",
    "- Vague questions! Questions that aren't specific or don't provide context\n"

    "    - Same as data-driven decisions but there is another layer. That extra layer allows people to use data to consider a broader range of ideas: drawing on comparisons to related concepts, giving weight to feelings and experiences, and considering other qualities that may be more difficult to measure. \n",
    "- __Data-driven decisions__ is using facts to guide business strategy\n",
